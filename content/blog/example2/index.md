Well-thought-through product announcements will help increase feature awareness and engage users with new functionality. Just like [sharing your public roadmap](https://canny.io/blog/should-you-have-a-public-roadmap/), it's also a great way to let potential customers see that you're constantly improving.
```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1, as_frame=False)
mnist.keys()
```
